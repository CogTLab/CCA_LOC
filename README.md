# Canonical correlation analysis identifies a neurophysiological marker of adaptation capacity that is reliably linked to internal locus of control of cognition in amnestic mild cognitive impairment

Use of Canonical Correlation Analysis to identify a shared neurophysiological marker of vagal control from electrocardiogram (during auditory working memory) and functional connectivity (FC) data.

<i>Complete Data CCA.xlsx </i> contains the data of two datasets: CogTe (divided in SampleO and SampleR) and ESB (divided in Nback and Stroop).
 <ul>
  <li>Sheet 1: SampleO with RMSSD, FCs (between and within), PICs (internal and external), and demographic information</li>
  <li>Sheet 2: SampleR with RMSSD, PICs (internal and external), and demographic information</li>
  <li>Sheet 3: SampleV Nback with RMSSD, PICs (internal and external), and demographic information</li>
  <li>Sheet 4: SampleV Stroop with RMSSD, PICs (internal and external), and demographic information</li>
</ul> 

 <i>CCA_code.R </i> is the R code used to calculate CCA and do linear regression with the canonical variates and internal or external PIC.
